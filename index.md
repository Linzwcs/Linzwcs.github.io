## About Me

Hello, I'm Zhilin Wang, an undergraduate students at Jilin University. I used to focus on detection tasks in NLP, such as sarcasm detection or AI text detection. Recently, I have read some papers about agent, RAG, and LLMs alignment, and I want to do something interesting in these fields

## Research Interests

- **Neural Language Processing:** AI text detection, RAG, LLMs alignment

## Projects

- [PASTED] A paraphrased text span detection method, which recognizes the distinct writing patterns of AI-paraphrased spans compared to the surrounding text.<i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Repo](https://github.com/Linzwcs/PASTED)
- [DeTect](https://detect.westlake.edu.cn/#/): AI-generated text detection system built on a comprehensive dataset containing 447,674 human-written and machine-generated texts from various sources. <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Repo](https://github.com/yafuly/DeepfakeTextDetect)
- **Computer-Graphics-Lab-For-JLU**: Developed to update Jilin University's Computer Graphics course experiments, based on games101 and including a complete implementation of a rendering pipeline.<i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Repo](https://github.com/Linzwcs/Computer-Graphics-Lab-For-JLU)
